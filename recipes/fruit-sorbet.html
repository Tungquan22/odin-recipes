        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Sorbet includes just a few simple ingredients, and is incredibly simple to make. Intensely strawberry-flavored, it's also a brilliant red. It's a striking dessert, whether served alone or paired with simple crisp sugar cookies.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup (227g) water</li>
            <li>3/4 cup (149g) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>454g strawberries, fresh preferred</li>
            <li>1/3 cup (78g) lemon juice or lime juice, freshly squeezed</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the water and sugar in a medium-sized saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Simmer for 5 minutes, without stirring. Remove the syrup from the heat, pour it into a bowl, and set in the refrigerator to cool</li>
            <li>Wash and trim the strawberries.</li>
            <li>Place the strawberries in the work bowl of a food processor. Process until fairly smooth, but not puréed.</li>
            <li>Add the syrup and citrus juice, and pulse briefly, just to combine. The syrup doesn't have to be cold, but it shouldn't be boiling hot, either. Lukewarm or cooler is fine.</li>
            <li>Place the mixture in a shallow pan; an 8" x 8" or 9" round cake pan are both good choices. Place the pan in the freezer. There's no need to cover it.</li>
            <li>After 2 hours, use a fork or spoon to stir it around, bringing the frozen edges into the center. Return to the freezer.</li>
            <li>Continue to stir every hour or so, until the sorbet is nearly as firm as you like. This may be as little as 4 hours total, start to finish; or it may take longer, depending on the temperature of your freezer. Once the sorbet is entirely icy (like a slush drink), you can purée it in a food processor or using a hand blender, if you like. Place in a bowl, cover, and return to the freezer.</li>
            <li>Sorbet should be ready to serve about 4 to 6 hours after you first put it into the freezer. Waiting a couple of hours beyond that will solidify it beyond scoopable. To serve beyond that window, allow sorbet to soften slightly at room temperature; this will only take about 10 minutes. Scoop into dishes and serve.</li>
        </ol>
